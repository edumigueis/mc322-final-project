![Example Image](repo/image2.png)

## Summary
This project, implemented in Java, is a practical travel itinerary planner designed to help users optimize their trips based on their preferences. The application offers suggestions for various activities, museums, restaurants, and cultural events in the chosen city, enabling users to create detailed itineraries with filters for prices and operating hours, and also calculate the most effective means of transport between selected destinations.

## About the Project
Upon launching the program, users are greeted with a modern and intuitive graphical interface built with JavaFX and customized with CSS. They can choose to create a new itinerary from scratch by selecting a city and travel dates or continue an existing itinerary by loading a saved XML file.

Key Features:
- **Create Itinerary**: Choose a destination city and travel dates to start planning from scratch.
- **Add Activities**: Browse through famous tourist spots with brief descriptions and photos, and add them to your itinerary.
- **Filters**: Apply filters based on category (museums, parks, restaurants, theaters, tourist sights) and price range.
- **Transport Calculations**: Automatically calculates the most efficient means of transport and the associated time and costs between activities.
- **Reorder Activities**: Easily change the order of activities and the application will recalculate timings and transport.
- **Save Itinerary**: Save your itinerary to an XML file for easy access later.

Technical Highlights:
- Extensive use of object-oriented programming principles such as relationships between classes, polymorphism, and composition.
- Implementation of design patterns including Singleton, Model-View-Controller (MVC), Strategy, and Factory Method.
- Custom exception handling for user inputs such as dates, times, and price limits.
- Serialization and deserialization of data using Jackson's `XmlMapper`.
- Utilized libraries: JavaFX, Kordamp, and Gluon.

## Built With
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **JavaFX**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **CSS**: For custom styling of the interface.
- **Jackson**: For XML serialization and deserialization.
- **Kordamp**: To facilitate development with JavaFX.
